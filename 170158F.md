## * Smart Contracts
Blockchain network use Smart Contract to provide controlled access to the ledger. As well as it enable a whole host of ledger functions like trassactions, querying and support consistent update of information. Smart Contracts is also a key mechanism for encapsulating information and keeping it simple across the network.

## * Distributed Ledger
The main part of the blockchain network is Distributed ledger and it is decentralized and collaborative. That mean it is replicated across many network participants. Distributed ledger help to records all the transactions that take place on the network. Transaction is validate by cryptographic techniques(eg- proof of work, proof of stake) then added to the ledger.
